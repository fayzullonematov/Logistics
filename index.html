                <p>
                    Logistics is the backbone of global trade and industry. It teaches students how to plan, organize,
                    and control the movement of goods, services, and information from origin to destination.
                    The program blends economics, business management, data analysis, and operations research to
                    develop professionals who can optimize complex supply chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In university, students explore both the analytical and strategic dimensions of logistics,
                    learning to design efficient networks, reduce costs, and enhance sustainability in transportation
                    and distribution systems.

                <h2>History of Logistics</h2>
                <p>
                    The term “logistics” comes from the Greek word <em>logistikos</em>, meaning skilled in calculating.
                    Its roots trace back to ancient military operations where organizing troops, weapons, and supplies
                    was crucial for victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 20th century, logistics evolved beyond warfare into business and technology.
                    With the rise of globalization, digitalization, and e-commerce, logistics became one of the
                    most influential forces shaping how modern societies function.
