                <p>
                    Logistics is the part of supply chain management that deals with the efficient forward and reverse
                    flow of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of
                    consumption according to the needs of customers. Logistics management is a component that
                    holds the supply chain together. The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods
                    such as materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as food and other edible items. Military
                    logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines with food, armaments, ammunition, and
                    spare parts, apart from the transportation of troops themselves. Meanwhile, civil logistics deals
                    with acquiring, moving, and storing raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods. For
                    organisations that provide garbage collection, mail deliveries, public utilities, and after-sales
                    services, logistical problems must be addressed.

                    In university, students explore both the analytical and strategic dimensions of logistics,
                    learning to design efficient networks, reduce costs, and enhance sustainability in transportation
                    and distribution systems.

                <h2>History of Logistics</h2>
                <p>
                    The term “logistics” comes from the Greek word <em>logistikos</em>, meaning “skilled in
                    calculating.”
                    Its origins can be traced back to ancient military campaigns, where the efficient movement of
                    troops, weapons, and supplies often determined victory or defeat.
                    Commanders like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar relied on precise planning and resource
                    management long before the term itself was formalized.
                    As empires expanded, logistics evolved into a science of coordination — ensuring that armies,
                    merchants, and explorers could reach distant territories without exhausting their supplies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Industrial Revolution, logistics entered a new era.
                    Railroads, steamships, and later automobiles transformed the speed and scale of distribution,
                    linking factories to global markets.
                    By the 20th century, logistics had expanded far beyond the battlefield into the realms of business,
                    production, and international trade.
                    The emergence of containerization in the 1950s revolutionized shipping, while advances in computing
                    and data analysis introduced new possibilities for optimization and tracking.
